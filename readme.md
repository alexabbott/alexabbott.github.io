# Grailed Code Test

This code test includes three directories, each with a different structure, and slightly different functionality.
These examples are meant to demonstrate multiple ways to fulfill the requirements provided in the prompt.

## Directory Structure

`/exercise` - a sample application that loads 5 images at a time onto a page, with ability to start and stop the loading process

`/mockup` - a simple example of code that fulfills the requirements for buildling a landing page based on the design in `mockup.png`

`/angular-mockup` - a more complex example of code that fulfills the requirements for buildling a landing page based on the design in `mockup.png`
